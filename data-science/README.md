##Scraping

###Concepts
* **Website Mirroring** - WHen we first start to aggregate data we will need to build a scraper that will mirror each individual news source. This process will take days to months depending on how much legacy data we want to gather.

* **Daily Updates** - Go to the homepage of the website and scrape all of the newest articles.
